**Democratizing AI Access through Community-Shared Subscriptions**

hoshyay.app is a non-profit organization dedicated to making powerful AI tools like ChatGPT Plus more accessible to a wider audience. We believe that the benefits of AI should be available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

To achieve this goal, we have developed a local GUI interface that allows multiple users to share a single ChatGPT Plus subscription. This subscription-sharing model dramatically reduces the cost of access to AI tools, making them more affordable for individuals and communities.

In addition to providing a subscription-sharing platform, hoshyay.app also offers a variety of resources to help users get the most out of AI tools. We provide tutorials, documentation, and community support to help users learn how to use AI effectively in their work, education, and personal lives.

We invite you to join us in our mission to democratize AI access and empower communities around the world.
